# Vagrant Provision

This repo is a spike to help get a good development environment automated. 
"Good" is obviously subjective, so I'm including the things that are important to me.
Namely:

* Ubuntu
* Git
* Vim
* Docker
* Ruby
* Elixir


Hopefully the Git and Docker will keep me from having to install a bunch of other garbage on these virtual boxes.

### Running it
You should be able to run this box using `vagrant up` and then `vagrant ssh`

#### Requirements

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

That might actually be it...
